			<p id="abio">Hi! I'm Andrew Stuempfig, and I am currently a senior at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. I am majoring in Business Economics, with a minor in Computer Science. I have interned at both SRF Consulting Group, Inc. and AXA Advisors. Outside of the classroom, I have played soccer my entire life, including four years on the team at St. Thomas, and I currently produce a soccer podcast.</p>

		<p id = "vinhDescription">Hello there! My name is Vinh Nguyen and I am currently a junior at the University of St. Thomas studying computer science. Originally from Massachusetts I came all the way to Minnesota for college. Some of my interest include sports and food. Fun fact about me is that I can juggle pretty well. Not only spheres but really just about anything that won't hurt me if I hold it. Also know how to work with Devil Sticks and use to dabble with Diabolo (the big yoyo).
		That is a little bit about me, hope you enjoy looking through our website!

		<h1>Tools Used in the Application</h1>
			<p>Leaflet API: Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library that allows for interactive maps to be rendered on a web page. Different data and images can be added onto the maps, and it can be extended with plugins.</p>
			<p>Open AQ Platform API: This API has historical air quality information from the previous 90 days, gathered from locations around the world. The API is frequently updated with the latest data about various air particles. </p>
			<p>Vue Framework: Vue is a lightweight framework, whose components can be written in JavaScript. It makes use of a virtual DOM for changes, and it supports two-way data binding, which was especially important for this application.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h1>6 Interesting Facts</h1>
			<p>1. Madrid has relatively low averages for most particles compared to other large cities in Europe, except for carbon monoxide, which is relatively high at 330.7 µg/m³.</p>
			<p>2. Compared to Europe, the US, and China, the average particle levels in Australia are extremely low. Almost every measurement is in the "Good" level, even in the larger cities such as Sydney and Brisbane. </p>
			<p>3. In Mumbai the level of pm25 has continually varied over the past month, consistently ranging from around 10 µg/m³ to around 50 µg/m³, with a few spikes reaching as high as 90 µg/m³, which is in the "Moderate" level.</p>
			<p>4. We looked up worst air qualities in America and found that California ranked very high. Being curious we thought of comparing the air quality in California to a place like China, known for not having the best of air qaulities. We specifically compared it to Beijieng and found that Beijieng is drastically worse than California, with a lot of the data falling under "Very Unhealthy" and "Hazardous". In conclusion, America's worse air quality is relatively not so bad in comparison to a country like China</p>
			<p>5. pm2.5 which is partical matter including combuston particles, metals and organic compounds are found to be more commonly higher in densely populated areas. We tested this through cities in New York and cities with less population density like Alaska or Texas.</p>
			<p>6. Places surrounded by water have been found with good air quality, places like Australia, Japan, and Hawaii.</p>
