			<p id="abio">Hi! I'm Andrew Stuempfig, and I am currently a senior at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. I am majoring in Business Economics, with a minor in Computer Science. I have interned at both SRF Consulting Group, Inc. and AXA Advisors. Outside of the classroom, I have played soccer my entire life, including four years on the team at St. Thomas, and I currently produce a soccer podcast.</p>
